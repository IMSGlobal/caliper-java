 * A CourseSection is a way to represent a group of people associated with a course or class.
 * These groups may include everyone in the class or course, or may be subsets of that whole group.
 * CourseSections may have sub-sections (these are created as separate Group objects linked using
 * the relationship). Examples of a CourseSection are Lecture, Laboratory, Studio, Seminar, etc.
 * There may be several instances of a type of CourseSection e.g., multiple lectures.
 *
 * A Caliper CourseSection provides a subset of the CourseSection properties specified in the
 * IMS LTI 2.0 specification, which in turn, draws inspiration from the IMS LIS 1.0 specification.
